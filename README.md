### Hi, I'm Fede 👋🏻👨🏼‍💻

![me](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86263343/213335553-09650828-d313-46fb-85ae-af7f6e6b5a1a.png)

I'm a self-taught frontend developer who loves to face new challenges.

## Let me tell you a bit about my background

🔶I worked over 4 years in Accounting roles. During this time I mastered my organization and financial skills.

🔶I took some time off my professional career during 2019, went to Australia, did some random jobs and improved my English level.

🔶Finally I came back home in 2020 and decided to pivot to a different industry and ended up discovering that I really like to code. As a self-directed learner, during this time I focused on building a solid knowledge foundation while also feeding my curious self that want(ed) to learn everything about this new industry.

## Now let’s talk about my tech skills 👩‍💻

✅As a fuontend web developer, I work daily with React, Vue, HTML, CSS/SASS. Python, Django, GraphQL, Git and REST API.

✅ As a team leader, I know how to organize a project using agile methodologies, guide and mentor my team members and take into action complex business ideas.

✅I have basic knowledge in Solidity as well.

 🚩 Keep mastering my Frontend Skills in React projects

 🔐 I am also deeply interested in Blockchain development (Even more if it involves criptocurrencies as it's a mix of tech and finance ❤️)
